"""The general GPT seam (v2 §9 Step 2 / §12; spearhead.md §B, C1).

The single place an outfit-generation backend is abstracted. ``Generator`` mirrors
``sampler.SignalScorer``'s seam style: a tiny ``Protocol`` the pipeline depends on, so
the rescue/daily/upgrade/translate flows inject a backend rather than hard-wiring one.

Two implementations matter:
  - ``OpenAIGenerator`` — the **only** module that touches ``openai`` / does network IO.
    The import is **lazy/local** to ``generate`` so ``fitted_core`` imports cleanly with
    the dependency absent (spearhead.md §B/§J): the pytest suite never installs ``openai``.
  - ``StubGenerator`` — a canned-JSON test double, homed in ``tests/helpers.py`` (NOT here),
    so runtime code never imports from ``tests/`` (spearhead.md §B). A CLI ``--dry-run``
    fixture generator lands separately at C6.

A ``Generator`` returns **raw response text** (a JSON string). It does no parsing,
validation, or repair — those are the validator's (§13) and ``rescue()``'s job. The one
§12 JSON-repair retry is owned by ``rescue()`` (a blind re-generation), never here
(spearhead.md §B/§G step 7).

Sources: docs/Fitted_Spec_v2.md §9/§12, docs/plans/spearhead.md §B/§D/§G.
